          <h2>Aspiring MERN Stack Developer</h2>

          <p>
            I am currently pursuing M.Voc in Software Application Development 
            at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) with a 
            specialization in the MERN Stack.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am a motivated and self-driven aspiring MERN Stack Developer 
            with a strong foundation in JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, 
            Express.js, and MongoDB. I have hands-on experience building 
            full-stack applications and designing RESTful APIs.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am eager to apply my technical knowledge in a professional 
            environment, contribute to real-world projects, and continuously 
            improve my development skills.
